# Arjuna

A minimal independent set calculator. Using the original idea of MIS and B+E, with quick fused queries, using inverted and mass queries for fast heuristic search.

Name is taken from the Hindu myth where [Arjuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna) is known for being the "one who concentrates the most". This system is also used as a preprocessor for our tool [ApproxMC](https://github.com/meelgroup/ApproxMC) to concentrate on counting only over the independent set.
